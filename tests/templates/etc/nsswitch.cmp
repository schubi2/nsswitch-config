# This file will not be overwritten if the comments above are removed.

#
# Valid databases are: aliases, ethers, group, gshadow, hosts,
# initgroups, netgroup, networks, passwd, protocols, publickey,
# rpc, services, and shadow.
#
# Valid service provider entries include (in alphabetical order):
#
#	compat			Use /etc files plus *_compat pseudo-db
#	db			Use the pre-processed /var/db files
#	dns			Use DNS (Domain Name Service)
#	files			Use the local files in /etc
#	hesiod			Use Hesiod (DNS) for user lookups

#
#	ldap			Use LDAP directory server

#	mymachines		Use systemd machine names
#	mdns*, mdns*_minimal	Use Avahi mDNS/DNS-SD

#	systemd			Use systemd for dynamic user option

#
# Notes for individual changes which have to be done by own snippeds in
# the /etc/nsswitch.conf.d directory:
#
# 'sssd' performs its own 'files'-based caching, so it should generally
# come before 'files'.
# Allow initgroups to default to the setting for group.
